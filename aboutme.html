        <h2>My name is Amay Bhardwaj. I like to code various games using visual studio code.</h2>
        <p>I started learning coding a few months ago. My hobbies include coding, playing sports, drawing, and helping parents out with cooking.
            I have a brother who like to code and play sports. These games were made in a span of days and some were inspired from my favorite
            games. I learned how to make infinite runner games, games using physics engine, multiplayer gamers, and also how to make websites.
            This is my portfolio website with some of my games which I enjoyed making.</p>
